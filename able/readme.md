# Crafting an OLX Page with HTML and CSS

I put together the OLX page for Scooters using HTML and CSS. 
- I used Flexbox in CSS to organize cards efficiently,
- Dug into the 'Inspect Element' tool to mimic the site's styling precisely, making sure it looked just like the official OLX page.

My team chipped in to tweak the navigation, aside sections, and footer. media queries is added to make the page responsive, making it much friendlier for users on smaller screens. 
This revamp significantly improved the page's usability across different devices, making it easy and smooth for everyone to navigate.
